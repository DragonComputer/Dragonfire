<category><pattern>DOES NEEDLE EXCHANGE INCREASE DRUG *</pattern><template>  No. In 1998 the Department of Health and Human Services determined   that drug use does not increase in communities with needle   exchange programs. Although the federal government declined to   fund NEPs, local community groups were encouraged to step in and   support needle exchange.  </template></category>  
<category><pattern>DOES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PREVENT TRANSMISSION *</pattern><template>  Repeated scientific studies say yes.

<category><pattern>HOW LARGE IS THE HEPATITIS C PROBLEM</pattern> <template>  A large number of Americans were infected with Hepatitis C through the blood supply, which was not systematically screened for the virus until 1992. 720 Georgians have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C disease since 1993; many more are infected but not ill. Since the blood supply is now safe and the virus is not easily transmitted sexually, most new cases of Hepatitus C are attributable to injection drug use.  </template></category>    
<category><pattern>HOW LARGE IS THE HIV AIDS *</pattern><template>      Nationally there have been over 600,000 people diagnosed with AIDS        since 1981. 25% if AIDS cases were linked to injection drug use.        An unknown number of Americans are infected with HIV. Georgia,        with approximately 18,700 cases reported since 1981, ranks among        the top ten states with the most AIDS cases. As many as 30,000        Georgians are estimated to be infected with HIV; 20% of 1998 AIDS        diagnoses were linked to injection drug use. In Atlanta, there is        an estimated 20,000 injection drug users. It is not known how many        are infected with HIV.     </template></category>

<category><pattern>IS NEEDLE EXCHANGE COST EFFECTIVE</pattern><template>  Yes. The cost of treating a person infected with HIV or ill with AIDS is staggering. Teatment for HEP C is also expensive. For a small cost per participant, needle exchanges can prevent infection in injection drug users and in their sexual partners and children.  </template></category>    
<category><pattern>IS SMOKING *</pattern><template>It depends what you smoke and how.</template></category>  
<category><pattern>LEGALIZING PROSTITUTION</pattern><template>Jud Presmont's plan is called "Art to the Rescue."  Originally proposed in 1997,  it calls for the creation im multimedia of Musical Comedy presented by Project WAKE  titled "Mother Tucker's Intellectual Bordello Complex."  Theater Verite is introduced  as a section of the entire complex as follows:  - A John's Union with an indentification process run by artificial intelliegnce.  - Free administratative services provided by project WAKE.  - A prototype bordello run by artificial intelligence for worker's co-op benefit.  - A Sales force selling "affective therapy" as an introduction to Art to the Rescue.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">  LEGALIZING PROSTITUTION  </set></set></think>  </template></category>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF NEEDLE EXCHANGES</pattern><template>  Laws instituted before HIV hinder the implementation of comprehensive prevention programs, including needle exchange. Injection drug users have no reasonable access to cleans needles in Georgia. Other U.S. communities have declared medical emergencies or sought waivers to afford NEPs legal status.  </template></category>    
<category><pattern>WHAT IS WEED</pattern><template>Any undersired, uncultivated plant, especially growing in profusion so as to crowd out a desired crop, disfigure a lawn, etc.  Also a term for marijuana.</template></category>

<category><pattern>WHY IS NEEDLE EXCHANGE *</pattern><template>      People infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), Hepatitis        C, and other diseases when they share needles. Both HIV and        Hepatitis C can be fatal. Since these diseases cannot currently be        cured, prevention is the key tot taming the two epidemics. Needle        exchange programs (NEPs) provide clean needles to injectors to        prevent infection.     </template></category>
